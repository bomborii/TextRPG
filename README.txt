This is a program written in C# that is designed to run in a Visual Studio environment.
This program is a text-based Role Playing Game (RPG) designed to challenge my design 
process skills while making a video game. The game did not have any particular mechanical
challenges, but the process of designing a "large-scale" game proved to be very challenging.
This project taught me that many things go wrong during the development of a program, and 
the time-frame of a large project often exceeds one's estimates.
